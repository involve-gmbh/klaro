# Klaro and Vite 

This example shows how to import and use Klaro as a node module via Vite.

Make sure you run `npm run build` (**in the main Klaro directory**) to generate the required distribution files in the `dist` directory that this example will try to import.

To install the dependencies, run

    npm install

To build the distribution files, simply run

    npm run build

To run a development server run

    npm run dev

You can then go to http://localhost:5173 and should see the Klaro consent
manager with a very simple configuration.
